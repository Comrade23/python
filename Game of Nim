# The game of NIM is required to have the following 4 functions

def main(): # driver of the program
  # Import Random int function
  from random import randint
  
  # Determine turn (computer or player)

    
  # Setup the game: number of balls to start (random), mode of computer (random dumb or smart), who goes first (random computer or player)
  play the game after the setup until either the player wins or the computer wins.

def computerDumbMode(ballCount):

  #Determine how many balls to start

  for computerDumbModeBallCount in range( 3 ) :
    computerDumbModeBallCount = randint( 10 , 100 )

  print( 'Computer Ball Count: ' , int( computerDumbModeBallCount ) )

def computerSmartMode(ballCount):
  
  for computerDumbModeBallCount in range( 3 ) :
    computerDumbModeBallCount = randint( 10 , 100 )

  print( 'Computer Ball Count: ' , int( computerDumbModeBallCount ) ) 



def playerTurn(ballCount):

  for playerTurnBallCount in range( 3 ) :
    playerTurnBallCount = randint( 10 , 100 )

    print( 'Player Ball Count: ' ,'%4d' % int( playerTurnBallCount ) )
  
def computer mode (dumb or smart):

  # Determine computer mode (dumb or smart)


Design the Game of Nim based upon the specifications given. Any design style may be utilized. Save the file as NimDesign
Use step-wise refinement on the design and separate out tasks into different modules (functions)
Implement the Game of Nim based upon your design that solves the problem. Name the file NimApp.py
You must implement the project using functions as designed above
